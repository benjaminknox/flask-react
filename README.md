  Flask React
</h1>

Because getting started developing web apps with flask and react can be easier, this boilerplate for developing them exists. This is a docker-compose script that builds a flask API with a react front end. Built so you can get right to coding an app.

## Usage

To use Flask React pull the repository and open the repository root, then run this command: 
```shell
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to go to http://localhost:5001 to see the front end after the initial build finishes. It's that simple.
